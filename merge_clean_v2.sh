### This script is used to merge the bands/layers of the ASDAF Smoke Data into a single netCDF.
### It will then compress the merged file using d9 compression, then update the file metadata to
### ensure CF compliance.

### Current version only handles active_fires_10000, active_fires_25000, active_fires_50000, active_fires_100000, active_fires_500000.
### Update code for additional bands.

ncatted -h -a comment,global,c,c,"This dataset is provided for use in a pilot project looking at building an API to optimise sharing of spatiotemporal gridded data output from satellite and other data modelling.

Please note that this is still a preliminary dataset only as whilst there are several layers here (number predictors out of range, prediction out of range etc) but the pm25_pred is the predicted smoke particles (PM2.5) and future versions will have decomposed that into PM2.5_Bushfire and PM2.5_Background, and a flag for if the pixel was dust or not. Therefore, this dataset is just a demo to see how we store the processed data and the data structures, as well as approximate data size estimates.
